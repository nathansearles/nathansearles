# Hi, I’m Nathan

I’m a **front-end developer and technical lead** with a deep understanding of design and development. I build fast, accessible interfaces that feel great to use, whether I’m deep in the code or leading a team. From design systems to complex builds, I focus on thoughtful, design-driven digital experiences.
